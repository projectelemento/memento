# Project Elemento - Memento

## About Memento
> Project Elemento wants to give you something momentous that you could possess while coming with us on the journey to finish the trilogy. The team created Memento NFTs â€” NFTs that future holders could hold while waiting.

> The Memento NFTs have their unique representation, which would be given differently depending on which level (OG, Whitelist) the designated holders belong. Once the card has been possessed, you'll start becoming a member of the Project Elemento community and always will be.
